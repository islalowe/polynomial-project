# Polynomial Project
# Polynomial Class


## Overview
This project defines and implements a Polynomial class in C++ that provides various functionalities for polynomial arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, evaluation, derivation, and integration. The class supports polynomials of any degree with floating-point coefficients.


## Features

### Construction and Destruction:
- Constructors to create polynomials with specified degrees and coefficients.
- Copy constructor and destructor to manage dynamic memory.

### Arithmetic Operations:
- Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of polynomials.
- Division of polynomials (both quotient and remainder).
- Derivation and integration of polynomials.

### Utility Functions:
- Evaluation of polynomials at a given value.
- Conversion of polynomial to a string representation.
- Reading and writing polynomials to and from streams.
- Comparison of polynomials for equality.
